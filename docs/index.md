# About this Project

Insecure software is undermining our financial, healthcare, defense, energy, and other critical infrastructure worldwide. As our digital, global infrastructure gets increasingly complex and interconnected, the difficulty of achieving application security increases exponentially. We can no longer afford to tolerate relatively simple security problems.

## Aim & Objective

The goal of the **OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls project** (OPC) is to raise awareness about application security by describing the most important areas of concern that software developers must be aware of. We encourage you to use the OWASP Proactive Controls to get your developers started with application security. Developers can learn from the mistakes of other organizations. We hope that the OWASP Proactive Controls is useful to your efforts in building secure software.

## Target Audience

This document is primarily written for developers. However, development managers, product owners, Q/A professionals, program managers, and anyone involved in building software can also benefit from this document.

## How to Use this Document

This documentâ€™s main purpose is to provide a solid foundation of topics to help drive introductory software security developer training. To be effective, these controls should be used consistently and thoroughly throughout all applications.

However, this document is a starting point rather than a comprehensive set of techniques and practices.

A fully secure development process should include comprehensive requirements from a standard such as the OWASP ASVS in addition to including a range of software development activities described in maturity models such as [OWASP SAMM](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project) and [BSIMM](https://www.bsimm.com/).
