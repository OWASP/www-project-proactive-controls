# About OWASP

The *Open Worldwide Application Security Project* (*OWASP*) is an open community
dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain
applications and APIs that can be trusted.

All OWASP tools, documents, videos, presentations, and chapters are free and
open to anyone interested in improving application security.

We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and
technology problem, because the most effective approaches to application
security require improvements in these areas.

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures
allows us to provide unbiased, practical, and cost-effective information about
application security.

OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the
informed use of commercial security technology. OWASP produces many types of
materials in a collaborative, transparent, and open way.

The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project's
long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer,
including the OWASP board, chapter leaders, project leaders, and project
members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.
