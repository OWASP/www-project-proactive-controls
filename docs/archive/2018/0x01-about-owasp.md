# About OWASP


The *Open Web Application Security Project* (OWASP) is a 501c3 non for profit educational charity dedicated to enabling organizations to design, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain secure software. All OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We can be found at [www.owasp.org](https://www.owasp.org).

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost effective information about application security.

OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company. Similar to many open source software projects, OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative and open way. The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success.
