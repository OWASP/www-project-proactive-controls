This information can be verified and trusted as long as it is digitally signed by a trusted authority. A JWT token is created during authentication and is verified by the server (or servers) before any processing. However, JWTs are often not saved by the server after initial creation. JWTs are typically created and then handed to a client without being saved by the server in any way. The integrity of the token is maintained through the use of digital signatures so a server can later verify that the JWT is still valid and was not tampered with since its creation. This approach is both stateless and portable in the way that client and server technologies can be different yet still interact. Please note, that if you are using JWTs you have to make sure that the returned JWT is actually using one of the signing algorithms that you are using. Otherwise, an attacker could try to create a JWT signed with the NULL algorithm, use a MAC-vs-Signature confusion attack, or provide a custom JWS key for signing. When you are issuing JWTs, make double-sure that you are using a secure private key for signing the JWTs: each output JWT gives an attacker all information needed to perform an offline cracking attack, so you should rotate keys frequently too.</p>"},{"location":"the-top-10/c7-secure-digital-identities/#browser-cookies","title":"Browser Cookies","text":"<p>Browser cookies are a common method for web applications to store session identifiers for web applications implementing standard session management techniques.
